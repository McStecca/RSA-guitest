RSA gui test is a personal test of an rsa application built entirely with python 3.7

The name is a work in progress

## Getting started
- Download main.pyw
- Download a file from [here](http://www.primos.mat.br/2T_en.html), unzip it and rename it primelist.txt
- Open main.pyw

You can choose between aio.py and main.py, aio.py is identical to main.py but has a button to do everything.
